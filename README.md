# 5800_Johnson-Project
Fall 2021: 5800 Final Project

### Overview
* Here is where we discuss an overview of Johnson's algorithm
* History
* Basic operations
* Time & Space complexity
* Why use Johnson's Algorithm
* Why a Fibonacci Heap increases the speed (Chart is sufficient for this)
* Why it is not useful or practical yet

### Illustration
* Here is where we put our illustrations/demo/visualization stuff

### Implementation, Tools, and Libraries
* Python obviously and why we chose it over Java. advantages, etc.
* Python Unittest library
* May need to discuss or use .heapq() https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html

### Instructions
* How to use the algorithm
* what valid inputs look like
* Create one simple code example
* Create one application to a real problem

### Reflection
* Challenges
* What went well
* What didn't go well
