 * An implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for single-source shortest
 * paths.  Like Dijkstra's algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm computes the
 * shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.  However,
 * unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm works correctly in
 * graphs containing negative-cost edges, so long as the graph does not contain
 * a negative cycle (in which case the cost of a shortest path may not be well-
 * defined).
 *
 * The Bellman-Ford algorithm, like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, is a classic
 * example of a dynamic programming algorithm.  The idea behind the algorithm
 * is to consider what the shortest path is from the source node s to each
 * other node in the graph, subject to the constraint that each path uses no
 * more than k edges.  When k = n, this contains all acyclic paths in the graph
 * and consequently, assuming that there are no negative cycles in the graph,
 * must contain the shortest paths in the graph.  The rationale behind phrasing
 * shortest paths this way is that if we denote by D(t, k) the length of the
 * shortest path from the source node s to node t using paths of length at most
 * k, it's possible to compute D(t, k) using the following intution.  First,
 * if we consider the case where k = 0 and all paths must have no edges, then
 * we get that
 *
 *    D(t, 0) = +infinity     (for t != s)
 *    D(s, 0) = 0
 *
 * Since there is no shortest path from s any other node using no edges, while
 * the path from s to itself using no edges has length zero.
 *
 * If we consider the case where k != 0, then there are two ways we could get a
 * shortest path from s to some node t using at most k edges.  First, it's
 * possible that the best way to do this is just to use some path using at most
 * k - 1 edges, either since no other paths exist (as would be the case in a
 * tree).  Alternatively, we could end up with a path of length at most k by
 * taking any path of length at most k - 1, then extending it by an edge.  For
 * each node in the graph, this means that we can compute the value of D(t, k)
 * as
 *
 *    D(t, k) = min{ D(t, k - 1), min ((u, t) in E){ D(u, k - 1) + l(u, v)}}
 *
 * Where l(u, v) denotes the length of the edge (u, v).
 *
 * This implementation computes this recurrence from the bottom up by beginning
 * with k = 0 and progressively increasing it until it reaches |V|.
 *
 * The runtime of this algorithm is easily determined.  We need to compute the
 * value of D(t, |V|) for each t, so O(|V|) iterations of the recurrence
 * computation are required.  On each iteration, for each node, we'll scan the
 * outgoing edges from that node, and so each iteration visits each edge
 * exactly once.  This takes time O(|E|), so the overall runtime is O(|V||E|).
 * An interesting detail about this algorithm is that since |E| = O(|V|^2), in
 * the worst case this algorithm runs in time O(|V|^3), which is the same
 * runtime as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.  However, Floyd-Warshall actually
 * produces the lengths of all paths between all pairs of points in this time,
 * and so it makes more sense to run Floyd-Warshall rather than Bellman-Ford!
 * That said, on sparse graphs (|E| = Theta(|V|)) the runtime is O(|V|^2),
 * which is much faster.
 *
 * The Bellman-Ford algorithm is interesting and useful for several reasons,
 * excluding historical relevance.  First, the update rule of the Bellman-Ford
 * algorithm can be computed in a distributed fashion, making it possible for
 * independent computers to each determine their distance from some predefined
 * computer using the algorithm.  This allows the algorithm to be used in
 * network routing protocols.  Second, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used
 * as a subroutine of Johnson's algorithm, an all-pairs shortest paths
 * algorithm that is asymptotically faster than the Floyd-Warshall algorithm on
 * sparse graphs.
